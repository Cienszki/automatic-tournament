# Balanced Fantasy Scoring System - Implementation Summary

## üö® **PROBLEM IDENTIFIED**

The original fantasy scoring system had massive imbalances:

- **Hard Supports**: 110.08 avg PPG (**152.5% advantage over Carry!**)
- **Soft Supports**: 59.82 avg PPG
- **Carries**: 43.59 avg PPG 
- **Mid**: 42.49 avg PPG
- **Offlane**: 45.23 avg PPG

**Root Causes:**
1. **Win bonus too powerful** (15 points √ó 5 players = 75 points for same-team lineups)
2. **Assist multipliers too high** (2.5x-3.0x for supports)
3. **Core roles severely undervalued** despite game impact
4. **Team performance dominated individual skill**

**Result**: Users picking all players from winning teams dominated leaderboard with identical scores.
