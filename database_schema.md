# Firestore Database Schema Documentation

This document outlines the structure of the Firestore database for the tournament tracker application.

### 1. `admins` Collection

This collection stores the User IDs (UIDs) of users who have administrative privileges.

-   **Path:** `/admins/{userId}`
-   **Document ID:** The Firebase Auth UID of the user.
-   **Purpose:** To control access to the admin panel. The application checks if a user's UID exists as a document ID in this collection to grant admin rights.
-   **Fields:** This collection does not require any specific fields within the documents. The existence of the document itself grants admin privileges.

**Example:**
To make the user with UID `abc123xyz` an admin, you would create an empty document at `/admins/abc123xyz`.
