- Primary color: Vibrant blue (#29ABE2) to represent energy and competition, reminiscent of esports branding.
- Background color: Light gray (#F0F2F5), to ensure that the content is easy to read, consistent with clean modern interfaces.
- Accent color: Electric purple (#B150F2), creating contrast to bring emphasis to calls to action. Purple has a hi-tech feeling appropriate for esports applications.
- Clean and modern sans-serif font for readability and a contemporary feel.

- Clear, structured layout to provide ease of access for finding information quickly. Information about Teams, Scores, and Schedule must all be very visible in the app.
