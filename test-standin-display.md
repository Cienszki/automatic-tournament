   - Accepts teams and standins props to resolve names

### Data Flow:
```
my-team/page.tsx
├── Fetches getAllTeams() and getAllStandins()
├── Passes teams[] and standins[] to components
└── Components resolve player/standin names using the data

StandinInfoDisplay
├── Receives match with standinInfo structure:
│   └── { [teamId]: { standins: [standinIds], unavailablePlayers: [playerIds] } }
├── Uses teams[] to resolve player names by team + player ID
├── Uses standins[] to resolve standin names by standin ID
└── Displays: "Original Player → Standin Player" for each replacement
```

## Example Display Format:

### Before (Generic):
```
🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Team Alpha
🔵 Unknown → ❌ Unavailable
```

### After (Detailed):
```
🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Team Alpha
❌ PlayerNickname → 🔵 StandinNickname
❌ AnotherPlayer → 🔵 AnotherStandin
```

## User Experience Improvements:

1. **Transparency**: Captains and viewers can see exactly who is playing
2. **Control**: Team captains can cancel standins if original players become available  
3. **Automatic**: No waiting for admin approval - standins are instantly assigned
4. **Comprehensive**: Standin information visible across all relevant match displays

All functionality is now working with proper error handling and user feedback!
